# TheMariCastProject
Mariners often struggle to find the required information to efficiently set sail, therefore, creating a centralized system where they can find relevant data would help increase the efficiency of ships as well as promote the safety of maritime operations. MariCast will provide mariners accurate marine weather data based on their location, active weather alerts, nautical charts, as well as depth and ranges so they can have the peace of mind when underway. Oftentimes mariners are left with having to sift through many government websites, old meteorological applications and physical mediums to find the results they want. This can be a time-consuming process in which with the MariCast project we hope to mitigate.
